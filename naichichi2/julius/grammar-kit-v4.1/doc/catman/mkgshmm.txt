NAME
       mkgshmm - convert monophone HMM to GS HMM for Julius

SYNOPSIS
       mkgshmm monophone_hmmdefs > outputfile

DESCRIPTION
       mkgshmm  converts  monophone HMM definition file (hmmdefs)
       in HTK format to a special  format  for  Gaussian  Mixture
       Selection (GMS) in Julius.

       GMS  is an algorithm to reduce the amount of acoustic com-
       putation with triphone HMM, by pre-selection of  promising
       gaussian mixtures using likelihoods of corresponding mono-
       phone mixtures.

       For more details, please  consult  related  documents  and
       papers

EXAMPLE
       (1)  Prepare  a  monophone  model which was trained by the
       same corpus as target triphone model.

       (2) Convert the monophone model using mkgshmm.

           % mkgshmm monophone > gshmmfile

       (3) Specify the output file in Julius with option "-gshmm"

           % julius -C foo.jconf -gshmm gshmmfile
